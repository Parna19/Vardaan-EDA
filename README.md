## Project Description
Vardaan EDA is a data-driven exploratory analysis project based on a real-world small business named Vardaan, which sells packaged food items, namkeen, and sweets. The business owner provided us with one yearâ€™s worth of sales and revenue data, which we used to uncover trends, understand growth patterns, and identify key sales drivers.

The primary objective of this project is to help the business gain deeper insights into its performance through data visualization and analysis. Using Python and popular data science libraries, we cleaned and processed the raw data, then created interactive charts and graphs to explore seasonal variations, product-wise contributions, and revenue fluctuations.

This project is particularly valuable to small business owners and aspiring data analysts who want to see how EDA can be applied to real-world retail data. The notebook is hosted on Google Colab and linked directly to GitHub for easy access and collaboration.

## Video Explanation

## Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn (for any preprocessing/ML if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (if run locally)
- CSV (for data storage)

## Steps to Run/Execute the Project

Will access the Project on GitHub

then visit the GitHub repository where this project is hosted.

Open the Notebook in Google Colab

Click on the notebook file (.ipynb) in the repository.

At the top of the file preview, click the "Open in Colab" button (if visible), or manually open it in Colab using this method:


For easier, process Repository link to access the code of the project is given below-

Ensure the Dataset is Loaded

Dataset is stored in the GitHub repo, the notebook should automatically load it using GitHub links or wget commands.

If not bychance in any case, we can upload the data manually in Colab.

Then, run the Notebook

Click on Runtime > Run all or run each cell one by one to execute the full analysis.

The notebook will perform data cleaning, EDA, and visualization steps automatically.

Review the Output and Insights

Scroll through the notebook/collab to view graphs, patterns, and conclusions based on the sales data.
